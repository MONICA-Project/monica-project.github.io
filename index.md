# About MONICA
Sound and security applications for large, open-air events in the city

The MONICA project is a large-scale demonstration of new and existing IoT applications for a smarter living. The demonstration involves six major cities in Europe: Lyon, Bonn, Leeds, Turin, Copenhagen and Hamburg.

Focus is on one of the key aspects of European society: the cultural performances in open-air settings which create challenges in terms of crowd safety, security and noise pollution.

To demonstrate how these challenges can be met through the use of technology, MONICA will develop, deploy and demonstrate three IoT ecosystems on security, acoustics and innovation, addressing real user needs. Within these systems, several applications are deployed, using IoT-enabled devices such as smart wristbands, video cameras, loudspeakers and mobile phones.
